# enjoy cmake

Enjoy the brief tutorial to use cmake, a perfect make tool for c and c++.


## why cmake, rather than make

- low learning curve
Compiling either a simple (like hello world) or a cocmplex (like KDE) project, cmake is quite good learning curve. 
- cross operation systems
supporting windows, linux, macos using the same cmake file
- cmake only depends on `make`


## setup 

- setup development tools (build-essential) in linux
refer to https://www.garron.me/en/go2linux/gnu-gcc-development-tools-linux-fedora-arch-debian.html
